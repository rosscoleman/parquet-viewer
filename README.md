Some data sets that are small enough to fit on a single workstation.

Parquet and Feature files are still preferable to CSVs because
* They are binary formats. Numeric data types are maintained.
* Data sets may fit on workstation local storage but not in RAM.

In these cases a desktop file viewer for Parquet and Feather files would be useful.
* Windows
* Mac
* Linux desktop environments

Double click a file and view it. Useful for colleagues that don't use Pandas, Dask, etc.
